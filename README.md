# Abstract
In todayâ€™s internet, there are many websites and applications circulating that utilize artificial intelligence technology to restore photos. However, the data used to train these websites for photo restoration mostly comes from countries outside Asia, such as Europe and America. Consequently, when applied to restoring photos of traditional Chinese architecture, the results are not ideal. Furthermore, due to environmental factors such as oxidation and humidity, many old photographs have become discolored and turned yellow. These elements make the process of restoring color photos even more challenging compared to restoring simple black and white images. Therefore, the objective of our research is to establish a machine learning model specifically dedicated to restoring photos of traditional Chinese architecture, utilizing data beyond the cur rently available photo restoration resources. This research model primarily focuses on three aspects: first, using a machine learning model to restore old photos, employ ing techniques like coloring, deblurring, and denoising; secondly, training the model with photos of varying color tone ratios and simulating aged or yellowed photos, then analyzing the outcomes of this training; finally, investigating the effects and impact of the number of model executions on photo restoration under different sequences of coloring, deblurring, denoising methods. During this investigation, it was found that the sequence of coloring, denoising, and deblurring yielded the most optimal results for restoring old photos. In addition, many old photos are severely damaged and have very few remaining features. Therefore, due to factors such as quality deterioration, many old photos preserve only minimal original features. Therefore, this study employs a machine learning model to reconstruct and extend the original appearance of the pho tos. Through this method, we aim to reconstruct scenes and situations that might have occurred around the buildings at the time the photographs were taken.
